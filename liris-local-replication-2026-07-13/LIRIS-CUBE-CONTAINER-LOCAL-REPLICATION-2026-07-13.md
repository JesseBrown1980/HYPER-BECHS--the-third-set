## Claim

The runnable evidence base from the Claude cloud container runs (GitHub Actions artifacts
8286095865, 8286842242, 8285893016 of repo `JesseBrown1980/HYPER-BECHS--the-third-set`) was
regenerated on LIRIS local metal, receipt-gated per field.

## Result

## Environment boundary

Cloud container ceiling ~4 GB; LIRIS default WSL envelope was 3.7 GiB + 1 GiB swap (nearly
identical). Replication ran with a 16 GiB drive-backed swapfile added to the RUNNING Ubuntu
instance (mosquitto and asolaria-host8-room-host never interrupted). This is consistent with
the operator's account that cloud mid-run failures were memory-ceiling casualties.

## Boundary

This receipt records LIRIS-local regeneration of container-pinned values. It does not promote
Canon, does not ingest into fabric, and does not assert anything about seats or runs LIRIS did
not execute. Trilateral standing (acer origin + cloud container + LIRIS metal) applies to the
values listed above only.
